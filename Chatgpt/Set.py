# 🔹 Why SETS are IMPORTANT for Data Science

# In real data you often have:

# duplicate IDs

# repeated values

# noisy data

# 👉 Sets automatically remove duplicates.




# a = [1,2,4,3,5,4,-2,-3,-4,-5, 0, 0, 0, 0] 
# print(set(a))


# In this they remove duplicates
# repeated values
# noise data
 
# a = [1,2,4,3,5,4,-2,-3,-4,-5, 0, 0, 0, 0] 
# b = set(a)
# print(len(b))
def clean(data):
    unique = set(data)
    return unique
print(clean([1,2,4,3,5,4,-2,-3,-4,-5, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
